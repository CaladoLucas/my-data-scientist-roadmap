### Why this?
I want to track the progress of my studies in this broad area. I do not intend to list a huge number of resources or courses, just the ones that I have completed so far and the following ones that are on my mind for a next step (in a short/medium or even long term). Anyway, valuable resources that may be part of my plan in the future.

# 1. Courses

This is a selection of books for Data Science and related disciplines from which I have good references. The books are listed in descending order of publication date.
